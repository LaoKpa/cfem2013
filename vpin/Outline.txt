1. Select evaluation criteria
 a. Does [a VPIN-like indicator] predict future prices? Over what time frame?
	Let's do this for 1-minute time bar VPIN, variable length time bar, then move on to VPIN based volume bars. As for the time period, we can start with the file you have provided us. If there is a positive correlation between VPIN and price movement, this effect should be able generalize. Yet we definitely want to use a time period of stressful data. 
	
 b. Does [a VPIN-like indicator] predict future volatility? Over what time frame?
	We will explore this after exploring the predictive power in price. 

2. Prepare data
 a. Identify and learn about tick data files.
	We will write R-code to parse the file you have provided.
 b. Produce a time series of observed returns or volatilities.
 c. Assign Buy/Sell label to each tick or bin.
 d. Aggregate and fit.

3. Analysis
	As for the techniques involved, I suggest we first try to use the techniques mentioned in Anderson's paper. After we get a feel of how well is the fit, we can tweak parameters, do different data transformation. And associate the relative performance of different VPINs. 

After we have done steps 1,2,3 for price change, we can move on to volatility.
